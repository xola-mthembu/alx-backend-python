# 0x01. Python - Async

This project covers asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use `async` and `await` syntax
- Execute an async program with asyncio
- Run concurrent coroutines
- Create asyncio tasks
- Use the random module

## Files

- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Basic async coroutine
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Execute multiple coroutines at the same time
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measure the runtime of coroutines
- `3-tasks.py`: Creating asyncio tasks
- `4-tasks.py`: Using tasks for concurrent execution
